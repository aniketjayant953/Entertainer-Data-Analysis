- **Pie Chart**: Illustrates the dataset's distribution between Singers and Actors. Actors dominate with 68%, indicating a preference for acting over singing. This trend suggests that acting may be perceived as requiring fewer skills than singing, often being more profitable.
- **Nominees vs Awards Won Stack Bar Chart**: Compares the number of awards won by entertainers to the number of nominations they received. Meryl Streep stands out with the most awards won and holds the record for the highest number of nominations.

### Page 3: Awards Analysis
